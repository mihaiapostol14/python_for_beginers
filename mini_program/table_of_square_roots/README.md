# Table of Square Roots

This mini-program provides a simple Python script to generate and display a table of square roots for a range of numbers. It is designed for beginners to understand basic programming concepts such as loops, functions, and mathematical operations in Python.

## Features

- Calculates the square roots of numbers in a specified range.
- Presents results in a clear, tabular format.
- Easy to customize the range and formatting.

## Usage

1. Open the relevant Python file in this directory (e.g., `table_of_square_roots.py`).
2. Run the script in your Python environment:
   ```bash
   python table_of_square_roots.py
   ```
3. The program will output a table showing each number and its square root.

## Example Output

```
Number    Square Root
1         1.00
2         1.41
3         1.73
...       ...
